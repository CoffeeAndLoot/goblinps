# GoblinPS manual test checklist

Frames and live game data cannot run outside the client. Add an entry for
every UI change.

## Probes to run before any code (WoW Forever beta, 1.60.1.69913)

These decide the design. Record the result beside each one.

- [ ] `/dump C_TaxiMap.GetTaxiNodesForMap(1411)` (Durotar) away from any
      flight master: returns nodes, each with `isUndiscovered` true or false
- [ ] Same call for a zone where the character knows no flight paths:
      `isUndiscovered` is true there and false for a known one
- [ ] A returned `nodeID` matches the `ID` of the same-named row in
      `docs/research/data/TaxiNodes.csv`
- [ ] Learn a new flight path: `TAXI_NODE_STATUS_CHANGED` fires
      (`/etrace` or `/eventtrace`) and the call above flips to discovered
- [ ] `/dump C_Map.GetPlayerMapPosition(C_Map.GetBestMapForUnit("player"), "player")`
      returns a position in the open world
- [ ] `/dump GetBindLocation()` returns the inn's area name
- [ ] Ctrl-click the world map: a waypoint pin appears; note which event
      fires in `/etrace`
- [ ] `/run C_Map.SetUserWaypoint(UiMapPoint.CreateFromCoordinates(1411, 0.5, 0.5)); C_SuperTrack.SetSuperTrackedUserWaypoint(true)`
      shows the pin and the on-screen arrow
- [ ] Note how each new zone is reached: Mount Hyjal, Zephras Isle,
      Darkspear Islands, Riverglades, Shen'dralas
